            <p>Boracay Island, one of the top beaches in the Philippines and one of the best Visayas tourist spots, is blessed with a long stretch of powdery white sand beach (called White Beach), crystal clear and azure waters, a stunning sunset, and more. The island doesn’t fall short on adventures and activities for people of all ages.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You'll never run out of exciting things to do in Boracay, from swimming, island hopping in the Philippines, diving, snorkeling, parasailing, kayaking, dining, and parties. Because of these, Boracay has been cited multiple times as one of the best islands and beaches in the world according to reputable publications and travelers' choice lists. </p>

            <p>Boracay Island was originally home to the Ati tribe. Boracay is part of Aklan Province, which became an independent province on April 25, 1956. Formerly undiscovered, it wasn’t till the 1970s that tourism began to develop in Boracay, and the island became popular with backpackers in the 1980s.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Decades ago, Boracay Island was a well-guarded secret, almost possessively so that only a few knew of its existence.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It was only in the 70’s when, it is said, a foreign movie crew accidentally “discovered” this island paradise. Others maintain that it was the German traveller, Jens Peters’ book, which included rave reviews of Boracay that changed the island’s pace from that of being a quiet secret to eventually being voted (like many other beaches in the Asian region) as having the best beach in the world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Whichever story is true, it was around this time that Boracay Island slowly ceased to be a private travellers hangout and eventually became a favourite tourist destination in the Philippines. In a span of a mere 10 years, the whole world, it seemed, discovered Boracay and the once, nearly deserted stretch of beach became a teeming vacation and leisure spot for upscale tourists from all parts of the world.</p>

        <h3>Boracay Travel Requirements & Guidelines | COVID-19 New Normal</h3>
        <br>
            <p>Domestic and foreign tourists can once again explore Boracay's clear waters and gorgeous stretches of white sand. But with the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) has released a set of guidelines and tourist requirements to follow and consider before you jump at the chance to book that ticket to Boracay.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
            <h3>Who are allowed to go to Boracay? </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Fully vaccinated domestic and foreign tourists, or those who have received their last dose of a COVID-19 vaccine at least two weeks prior to their travel, do not need to present a negative COVID-19 test result. They must instead present a vaccination certificate from vaxcert.doh.gov.ph or a locally issued vaccination card with a QR code or contact details of the vaccination center. Those vaccinated abroad can show an International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV) from the World Health Organization or a vaccination certificate issued abroad to prove their fully vaccinated status. Those who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated need to present a negative RT-PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to travel.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All travelers also need to present a valid ID that shows your Philippine residency (or a passport for foreigners and OFWs), roundtrip tickets, a confirmed booking with any of the DOT-accredited hotels and resorts in Boracay, and a screenshot of the OHDC confirmation page that you can get by registering via touristboracay.com.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For those traveling with children below 12 years old, a filled out Certificate of Undertaking Traveling with Minors from aklan.gov.ph is also required.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>        
            <h3>What travel requirements do you need to prepare?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Here are the requirements that you need to prepare before going to Boracay:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Get a Vaccination Certificate or Card (for Fully Vaccinated)</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p class="thingsJustify">Fully vaccinated individuals are exempted from presenting a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result and should instead present a vaccination certificate generated from vaxcert.doh.gov.ph. A vaccination card with a QR code or a vaccination certificate issued by the LGU of where the traveler got vaccinated will also suffice. If you were vaccinated outside the Philippines, a vaccination certificate or card issued abroad is also accepted, as well as an International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV) from the World Health Organization.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>A Certificate of Undertaking for Traveling with Minors (for those traveling with children below 12 years old)</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p class="thingsJustify">Parents or guardians of children aged 11 years old and below must fill out and submit a Certificate of Undertaking for Traveling with Minors which may be accessed here.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Secure a negative RT-PCR test result (For Unvaccinated or Partially Vaccinated)</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p class="thingsJustify">Unvaccinated and partially vaccinated travelers must secure a negative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test result taken not earlier than 72 hours prior to travel, so plan accordingly. Guests can also present a negative saliva RT-PCR test result as an alternative.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Filled out Health Declaration Form </h4>
                    <br>
                    <p class="thingsJustify">Visitors have to register online at .touristboracay.com to answer a health declaration form.

        <h3>What to Wear</h3>

            <p>
                Bring beach necessities such as swimsuit, rashguard, shirts, shorts, slippers, eyewear such as shades and goggles, towels, and a hat or cap. Wear sunblock so you can avoid getting sunburnt by the blazing heat of the sun.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Regardless of the season, make sure to bring an umbrella with you or borrow one from your hotel. It is to protect you from the heat of the sun and the unexpected downpour of rain.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Manoc-manoc</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Manoc-Manoc is the barangay you’ll set foot in first. It is where the island’s two passenger jetty ports — Cagban and Tambisaan ports — are located. Manoc-Manoc also includes Station 3, the southern end of White Beach.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Balabag</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Balabag is the center of the island, laced by White Beach in the west and Bulabog Beach in the east. Most of the island’s key attractions are located here including White Beach’s Stations 1 and 2.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Yapak</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Yapak occupies the northernmost and the most remote nooks of the island. Puka Shell Beach is its most well-known sand strip, but there are no accommodations on the beach itself. However, there are a few high-end resorts in Yapak.
